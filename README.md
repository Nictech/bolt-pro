# genesis-foundation
This project aims bring the Foundation Framework to the Genesis Framework in the most minimal way possible.
The goal is to have all the tools of foundation available to us in Genesis without large file sizes.

By importing the framework and using sass includes for things like the grid we are able to keep the file size much smaller.
